        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>Welcome to this minimalist project site. After years of running NPM install {very helpful packages here}
            every 30 seconds and running things behind 5 different frameworks I decided it's time to go back to basics
            and create a simple html hub for links and
            projects.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Me -->
    <div>
        <h1>Who?</h1>
        <p>I'm Patrick, a developer from Canada. I graduated from the Mohawk College Software Dev program in 2021. I've
            been
            interested and tinkering with computers every since getting my hands on one in ~2010.</p>
        <h2>The Facts (and opinions)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Mostly Web Dev through chance and the fact that I like sharing stuff through links</li>
            <li>I like javascript but hate it</li>
            <li>Don't like asp .net</li>
            <li>First language was C++</li>
            <li>Crypto is possibly the future</li>
            <li>$3000 pictures of cartoon monkeys might also be the future</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Links -->
    <div>
        <h1>SmiBuilder</h1>
        <p>A character builder for the game Smite. It allows users to plan item builds for characters in the game. Runs
            using a front end site to communicate with its API, and its main languages are Vue (nuxt) and Javascript
            (nodeJS). It's currently not updated and may go offline soon due the Azure sub running out. <a
